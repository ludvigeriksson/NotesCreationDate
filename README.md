# NotesCreationDate
Jailbreak tweak to show when notes were created in Apple's Notes app

Currently only iCloud and 'On My iPhone' accounts are supported. Suggestions on how to make other accounts supported as well are welcome.

There also seems to be something that makes this only works on some devices. It works on my iPhone 6 with iOS 9.0.2, but not on my iPhone 4S, also with iOS 9.0.2 (both using iCloud accounts).
